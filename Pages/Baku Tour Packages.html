                        2007, the Old City had a population of about 3000 people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku, including

                        ‚Ä¢ Tour will start with Ateshgah (Fire Worshippers Temple)
                        ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian place of worship.
                        ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for
                        monks and a tetra pillar-altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned
                        in the late 19th century, probably due to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural
                        "eternal flame" went out in 1969, after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but
                        is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                        ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word
                        "Yanardag" means "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a
                        natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near
                        Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself is known as the "land of fire."

                        City which is the historical core of Baku, the capital of
                        Azerbaijan. The Old City is the most ancient part of
                        Baku, which is surrounded by walls well protected. In
                        2007, the Old City had a population of about 3000
                        people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku,
                        including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and Maiden
                        Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be

                        distinctive architecture and flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after
                        Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan
                        Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

                        Temple)
                        ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the
                        temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian
                        place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the Persian word for
                        fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a
                        courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a
                        tetra pillar-altar in the middle, was built during
                        the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned
                        in the late 19th century, probably due to the
                        dwindling of the Indian population in the area.
                        The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969,
                        after nearly a century of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                        ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word
                        "Yanardag" means "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a
                        natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near
                        Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself is known as the "land of fire."

                        famous tourist attraction.
                        ‚Ä¢ The area has been settled since the 8th millennium
                        BC. It is known for hosting thousands of rock
                        engravings spread over 100 square km depicting
                        hunting scenes, people, ships, constellations and
                        animals. Its oldest petroglyphs date from the 12th
                        century BC. In 2007, UNESCO included the 'Gobustan

                        City which is the historical core of Baku, the capital of
                        Azerbaijan. The Old City is the most ancient part of
                        Baku, which is surrounded by walls well protected. In
                        2007, the Old City had a population of about 3000
                        people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku,
                        including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and Maiden
                        Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be

                        noted for its distinctive architecture and flowing,
                        curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is
                        named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of
                        Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of
                        Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October

                        Temple)
                        ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the
                        temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian
                        place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the Persian word for
                        fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a
                        courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a
                        tetra pillar-altar in the middle, was built during
                        the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned
                        in the late 19th century, probably due to the
                        dwindling of the Indian population in the area.
                        The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969,
                        after nearly a century of exploitation of
                        petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by
                        gas piped from the nearby city.
                        ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron
                        peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the
                        word "Yanardag" means "Blazing Mountain".
                        Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and
                        floor. Yanardag is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan,
                        which itself is known as the "land of fire."

                        ‚Ä¢ The area has been settled since the 8th millennium
                        BC. It is known for hosting thousands of rock

                        hunting scenes, people, ships, constellations and
                        animals. Its oldest petroglyphs date from the 12th
                        century BC. In 2007, UNESCO included the 'Gobustan
                        Rock Art Cultural Landscape' in the World Heritage

                    The Old City is the most ancient part of Baku, which is surrounded by walls well protected. In 2007, the Old City had a
                    population of about 3000 people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku, including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and
                    Maiden Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
                    ‚Ä¢ We will have a visit to the charming example of modern architecture - The Heydar Aliyev Center - a 57,500 m2 building
                    complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and
                    flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet
                    Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

                    ‚Ä¢ Tour will start with Ateshgah (Fire Worshippers Temple)
                    ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the
                    Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetra pillar
                    altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due
                    to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969, after nearly a century
                    of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                    ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word "Yanardag" means
                    "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a natural gas fire which blazes
                    continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself
                    is known as the "land of fire."

                        (New Boulevard) has virtually doubled the length to 3.75 km. We will proceed to Carpet Museum and Ferris wheel

                        The Old City is the most ancient part of Baku, which is surrounded by walls well protected. In 2007, the Old City had a
                        population of about 3000 people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku, including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and
                        Maiden Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
                        ‚Ä¢ We will have a visit to the charming example of modern architecture - The Heydar Aliyev Center - a 57,500 m2 building
                        complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and
                        flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet
                        Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

                        ‚Ä¢ Tour will start with Ateshgah (Fire Worshippers Temple)
                        ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the
                        Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetra pillar
                        altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due
                        to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969, after nearly a century
                        of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                        ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word "Yanardag" means
                        "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a natural gas fire which blazes
                        continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself
                        is known as the "land of fire."
