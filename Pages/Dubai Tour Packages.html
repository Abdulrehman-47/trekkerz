                    The Old City is the most ancient part of Baku, which is surrounded by walls well protected. In 2007, the Old City had a
                    population of about 3000 people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku, including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and
                    Maiden Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
                    ‚Ä¢ We will have a visit to the charming example of modern architecture - The Heydar Aliyev Center - a 57,500 m2 building
                    complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and
                    flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet
                    Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

                    ‚Ä¢ Tour will start with Ateshgah (Fire Worshippers Temple)
                    ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the
                    Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetra pillar
                    altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due
                    to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969, after nearly a century
                    of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                    ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word "Yanardag" means
                    "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a natural gas fire which blazes
                    continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself
                    is known as the "land of fire."

                    population of about 3000 people. In December 2000, the Old City of Baku, including the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and
                    Maiden Tower, became the first location in Azerbaijan to be classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

                    complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and
                    flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles. The center is named after Heydar Aliyev, the first secretary of Soviet
                    Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

                    ‚Ä¢ Tour will start with Ateshgah (Fire Worshippers Temple)
                    ‚Ä¢ Based on Persian and Indian inscriptions, the temple was used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian place of worship. ‚ÄúAtash‚Äù is the
                    Persian word for fire. The pentagonal complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetra pillar
                    altar in the middle, was built during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was abandoned in the late 19th century, probably due
                    to the dwindling of the Indian population in the area. The natural "eternal flame" went out in 1969, after nearly a century
                    of exploitation of petroleum and gas in the area, but is now lit by gas piped from the nearby city.
                    ‚Ä¢ Trip to Fire Mountain - "Yanardag" on Absheron peninsula, 25 km north of Baku. Literally, the word "Yanardag" means
                    "Blazing Mountain". Blazing bodies of flame dance on stones and floor. Yanardag is a natural gas fire which blazes
                    continuously on a hillside on the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian Sea near Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, which itself
                    is known as the "land of fire."
